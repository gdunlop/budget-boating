I got interested in boating after spending a lot of time at [Calshot Activities Centre](https://www.hants.gov.uk/thingstodo/outdoorcentres/ourcentres/calshot) where my son uses the climbing walls. The cafe has great views of Southampton Water and the Solent, and there are always boats of all shapes and sizes passing by.

This photo shows the centre, situated on Calshot Spit, looking south over the Solent towards Cowes on the Isle of Wight.

This blog documents my own experience [getting started]({{site.baseurl}}/Getting-started) with powerboating. Like most pastimes, it can be done on a modest budget if you're aware of all the costs and how they can be reduced or avoided altogether.

I hope you find it useful. Safe boating!
