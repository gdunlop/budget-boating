*A blog for anyone looking to get into powerboating on a budget*

## About this blog
This blog covers my experience getting into powerboating.

I got interested in boating through spending a lot of time at [Calshot Activities Centre](https://www.hants.gov.uk/thingstodo/outdoorcentres/ourcentres/calshot) where my son does climbing. The cafe has great views of Southampton Water and the Solent, and there are always boats of all shapes and sizes passing by.

This photo shows the centre, situated on Calshot Spit, looking south over the Solent towards Cowes on the Isle of Wight.

## Budget reading
Before looking to buy a boat I read a fair bit to increase my knowledge, including every back issue of [Motor Boat Owner](http://www.motorboatowner.co.uk) - this is free and I can't recommend it highly enough.

My local Oxfam book shop has also been a great resource, turning up a variety of books on navigation and motorboats.

## Training
Friends and colleagues recommended getting some training, so I enrolled on a [RYA Powerboat Level 2](https://www.rya.org.uk/courses-training/courses/powerboat/Pages/level-2.aspx) course with [Technical Recreational Coaching](https://www.technical-recreational-coaching.co.uk).

This is a great introduction to boat handling, basic navigation and safety spread over two days. Although you don't need any form of license or qualification to use a boat, courses like this are a great way to dip your toe in the water, so to speak.
