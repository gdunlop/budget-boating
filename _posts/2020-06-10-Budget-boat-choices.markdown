*What floats your boat?*

# Buying considerations

There are many factors to consider when you start looking for a budget boat:-
- Do you want a speedboat, day boat, RIB, walkaround...?
- Inboard or outboard engine?
- What type of hull profile?
- How many passengers do you need to accommodate?
- Where will you store it and launch it?

The last point is particularly important and I cover this in a separate article on boat storage options and costs.
