*What floats your boat?*

# Buying considerations
There are many factors to consider when you start looking for a budget boat:-
- Do you want a speedboat, day boat, RIB, walkaround...?
- Outboard or inboard engine?
- What type of hull profile?
- How many passengers do you need to accommodate?
- Where will you store it and launch it?

Some of these topics are quite involved and are covered in separate posts:-

# The hull truth
Hull shape is important as this can have a big effect on comfort and handling.

My boat (top image) has an older style V-profile with pronounced chines. This looks sleek and makes for exciting cornering but results in a hard ride - the concave shape is less effective at pushing water out of the way. Contrast this with a more modern "deep V" hull with a convex profile (bottom image). This pushes water out of the way making for softer landings.

# Style council
When it comes to shape and style of boat this is very much down to personal preference.

RIBs have a lot of fans - they are practically unsinkable and certainly more durable than a boat with a full fibreglass hull. However you sit (or stand) quite high up in a RIB so make sure you are happy with feeling this exposed.

I bought a speedboat as I wanted to sit *in* the boat rather than *on* it, and I liked the retro style. As it's a *bowrider* there's space for two passengers in the bow - the kids love it.

Walkarounds are also common - and very practical. As the name implies, you have good access to all areas of the deck
