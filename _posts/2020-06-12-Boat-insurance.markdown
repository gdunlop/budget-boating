*Protect your investment on and off the water*

# Requirements
As far as I know you are not legally required to have boat insurance, but many facilities will want to see at least third-party liability cover. It's also common sense to protect your investment against theft and damage.

Note that you are responsible for the wake you generate, which is more of an issue if you are boating inland. Elsewhere just make sure you stick to any speed limits in force.

# Securing a trailer
Insurers will want to see a trailer secured with a hitch lock and a wheel lock. These are easy enough to find on eBay or Gumtree. I paid £20 for the hitch lock and £30 for the wheel lock:

# Securing an outboard
Outboards also need to be secured with a dedicated lock. This 'volcano' style prevents the mounting point being attacked with a pry bar or bolt cutters. Expect to pay £50-£75 for a brand new lock like this:

# Budget boat insurance
There are specialist insurers dealing with boats so it pays to shop around. Some only operate online so will be a bit cheaper. Premiums are calculated based on boat length, maximum speed and insured value.

For an 18-20ft outboard powered trailer boat expect to pay in the region of £150-200 for an annual policy.

# Breakdown cover
If you are worried about breaking down - either at your berth or on a trip - it's a good idea to invest in breakdown cover.

These services are usually provided by local companies that operate in a fixed area. I took out an annual policy with [Seastart](https://www.seastart.co.uk) for a shade under £150. They will come out to you if you experience a breakdown within 3 miles of land and either fix the problem or tow you somewhere safe.
