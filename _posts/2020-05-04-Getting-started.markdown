*A few ways to get started with powerboating*

## Dip your toe in the water
If you know someone with a boat see if you can wrangle a day out on the water. This is a great way to experience powerboating first hand to see if you enjoy it.

Another great option is to go on a training course. The Royal Yachting Association (RYA) has designed a series of training courses for power vessels, including [RYA Powerboat Handling Level 2](https://www.rya.org.uk/courses-training/courses/powerboat/Pages/level-2.aspx). This is a popular 2-day course with a lot of time spent out on the water. It includes some classroom work as well, covering the basics of navigation, passage planning and safety.

I completed my Level 2 course with [Technical Recreational Coaching](https://www.technical-recreational-coaching.co.uk) in Southampton and highly recommend them. I also used them to obtain a [marine radio qualification](https://www.rya.org.uk/courses-training/courses/specialist/Pages/src.aspx) which is required to operate a fixed or handheld VHF radio.

## Budget boating books
Before looking to buy a boat I read a fair bit to increase my knowledge, including back issues from [Motor Boat Owner](http://www.motorboatowner.co.uk) - this is free and I can't recommend it highly enough.

My local Oxfam book shop has also been a great resource.

## Let's go surfing
YouTube is a great place to find out about boat handling, engine maintenance and working with ropes.

A few of my personal favourites:-

### Dangar Marine
Dangar Stu is based on Dangar Island on the Hawkesbury River north of Sydney. [Dangar Marine](https://www.youtube.com/user/DangarMarine) covers boat restoration, maintenance, ropework and lots more. This is a treasure trove for the budget boater - especially on engine troubleshooting and maintenance.

You can [become a patron of Dangar Marine](https://www.patreon.com/dangarmarine) to get insider access to existing and upcoming content.

### Born Again Boating
Run by a professional boat mechanic [Born Again Boating](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWZhbfXDCg7_PvlwvierP1A) is more US-centric covering bigger boats and engines, but still has lots of useful information about boat restoration and engine maintenance.

### Harry Dwyer
Harry is an "enthusiastic doer of fun stuff," including [restoring a tiny speedboat](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI9wxSG-v3nNsRis8S9x1PG32ookSSv5h).

Now it's restored and on the water Harry and friends are using it to travel [1700 miles around Great Britain](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI9wxSG-v3nM5TN7llb19jNnh8JUpmRe4). Very polished production with excellent drone footage and music.

### Tom Cunliffe
Tom is a sailor, writer and TV presenter. His YouTube channel - the aptly named [Yachts and Yarns](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrgLfFlVsszE1JSzYCmj9Yg) - mixes maritime history, sailing trips, and practical advice covering many aspects of boating.
