*A cheap upgrade that may improve handling and fuel efficiency*

### Foiled again
When I bought my boat I noticed four holes drilled in the cavitation plate on the outboard but had no idea what they were for.

I found out a hydrofoil must had been installed at some point. This is a 'wing' designed to provide additional lift and there are lots of claims about how it can improve handling and fuel consumption.

Additional lift at the stern should minimise bow rise when accelerating to planing speed but we'll wait and see if it provides any other benefits.

### Fitting

I bought a cheap hydrofoil from a local chandlery, making sure the distance between hole centres was the same as those already drilled in the plate.

An added advantage is this provides a bit of protection around the propeller.
