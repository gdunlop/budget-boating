*When is the right time to buy a budget boat?*

### Summer fun
There are always plenty of boats for sale so in truth you can buy a boat at almost any time. However, many boats will be in use during the Summer months so you'll find there are fewer boats for sale and there is higher demand.

Higher demand means prices for used boats are generally higher during the Summer, so I recommend you avoid looking to buy during this time. Instead, use the time to do your research - look at [budget boat choices]({{site.baseurl}}/Budget-boat-choices) and examine [boat storage options]({{site.baseurl}}/Boat-storage) to help narrow down your search.

If you find a boat for sale during the season that meets all your requirements then go for it. Make sure you inspect it thoroughly using a [good checklist]({{site.baseurl}}/Boat-checks-part-1) and try to get a sea trial.

### End of season sale
The boating season in the UK generally runs from April through to October. Many boats are removed from the water after that and stored away until the next season.

We know that [boat storage costs]({{site.baseurl}}/Boat-storage) can be significant, so you will find motivated sellers towards the end of the season who want to make a sale and avoid further charges.

### Winter warmer
Since many boats will be out of the water during Winter this is a more challenging time to sell or buy a boat. Sellers will be eagerly waiting the arrival of Spring, when longer days and better weather mean more potential buyers.

As a well-informed buyer you can use this to your advantage if you find a boat you are really interested in. You may be the only potential buyer which puts you in a stronger negotiating position, especially if the boat was advertised during the season and didn't sell.

### Tips for the budget boater
- Do your research during Summer and narrow down your requirements
- Start looking seriously towards the end of the season around August/September
- Don't hang around at end of season if you see a boat you like at a fair price
- If a boat you like is still for sale during Winter then negotiate to make sure you pay well below what it was advertised for in Summer
