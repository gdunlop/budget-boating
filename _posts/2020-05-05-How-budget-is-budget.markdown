*There are several ways to get into boating on a budget*

## Setting a budget
Everyone will have a different view of what "budget" means. You can find boats for a few hundred pounds, but at this price point don't expect something that is safe and ready for the water.

For less than £2,500 the options are quite limited but you can find older speedboats around 14-15ft. Increasing the budget to £5,000 you can expect to find more variety and at this price a decent trailer should be included. Stretching the budget even further up to £10,000 will tap into bigger, newer boats with good service history.

It's tempting to look for cheaper boats that need a bit of work, but avoid this unless you are very confident about the effort and costs involved. A better approach is to set a realistic maximum budget and find the best boat for the money that satisfies your requirements.

## Buying used
Needless to say given this budget you will be looking at used boats. Don't be afraid of looking at boats up to 30 years old - if they have been well looked after ideally by one owner you can get a lot for your money.

Be aware that older boats won't have current certification levels or category ratings. These systems exist to state what a particular boat is capable of, including the maximum number of passengers and the type of usage - inshore, offshore, capable of ocean crossings.

In the absence of standards and category ratings let common sense prevail. You wouldn't try to cross the Atlantic in a small speedboat, would you?!

## Shared ownership
This option is becoming more popular, especially where there is a thriving boating scene. It usually involves buying into a syndicate with a one-off payment plus ongoing monthly costs. Since you are buying a share, your budget will get you a bigger or newer boat, so long as you are happy with sharing access and use.

At time of writing this, I found a quarter share in a 6.75m RIB kept in a marina for £5,750 plus £90 per month.

## Join the club
If you prefer a fixed monthly cost with no upfront investment then a boat club may be suitable. Clubs provide access to a fleet of different boats for a monthly subscription covering everything except fuel.

The entry level price *(June 2020)* seems to be around £350 per month but this typically equates to only 12 days use a year. If you want more days or access to additional boats you pay more each month - anything up to £900.

If you don't want to own a boat this may work for you but I don't consider it a budget option.
