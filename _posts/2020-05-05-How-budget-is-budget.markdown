*Decide what type of boat you want and set a realistic budget*

## Setting a budget
Everyone will have a different view of what "budget" means. You can find boats for a few hundred pounds, but at this price point don't expect something that is safe and ready for the water.

For less than £2,500 the options are quite limited but you can find older speedboats around 14-15ft. Increasing the budget to £5,000 you can expect to find more variety and at this price a decent trailer should be included. Stretching the budget even further up to £10,000 will tap into bigger, newer boats with good service history.

It's tempting to look for cheaper boats that need a bit of work, but avoid this unless you are very confident about the effort and costs involved. A better approach is to set a realistic maximum budget and find the best boat for the money that satisfies your requirements.

## Buying used
Needless to say given this budget you will be looking at used boats. Don't be afraid of looking at boats that are up to 30 years old - if they have been well looked after ideally by one owner you can get a lot for your money.

## Shared ownership
This option is becoming more popular, especially in popular boating areas. It usually involves buying into a syndicate with a one-off payment plus ongoing monthly costs. Since you are buying a share, your budget will get you a bigger or newer boat, so long as you are happy with sharing access and use.

At time of writing this, I found a quarter share in a 6.75m RIB kept in a marina for £5,750 plus £90 per month.

## Join the club
If you prefer a fixed monthly cost with no upfront investment then a boat club may be suitable. Typically these provide access to a fleet of different boats starting from around £300 per month. Pay more and you'll get access to more boats, and more flexible use including overnight trips. If you don't want to own a boat this is good option, but I would hesitate to call it a budget option - the costs stack up fairly rapidly.

## Where to find budget boats
I recommend looking at classified ads where the owner is likely to have given a realistic asking price. Avoid auctions as it's just too easy to get caught in a bidding war.

Boat brokers and specialist boating sites are another option. Brokers sell boats on behalf of a customer - brokerage boats - and may also have trade-ins. At our budget these will often be *sold as seen* with no warranty so you need to inspect carefully before parting with your cash.

## Beware the project boat

Front gardens and boat yards across the country are littered with project boats. Probably bought at auction with the best of intentions, they may have been sitting unloved for years. Alternatively they've become a money pit for the current owner but just need "a few little things" to finish off. That may include small things such as installing a new engine...

Avoid project boats *unless* you find a very good example that you are prepared to put a lot of work - and cash - into.

## My personal experience
I looked at classified ads on eBay and Gumtree, as well as brokerage boats. I put a 10% deposit on a brokerage boat in the North of England, but unfortunately I made the mistake of paying this directly to the owner via a 'friends and family' payment. When it became apparent there were some issues with the engine I pulled out but the seller refused to return even a portion of the deposit. Caveat emptor...

I ended up buying a Fletcher Arrowhawk 180 from a private seller - a retired guy who bought and sold Fletchers. Although nearly 30 years old, it was on a brand new rollercoaster trailer with a receipt for £2,500 along with recent service history for the outboard. Best of all it had been used as a ski boat on fresh water so had little or no use in salt water. It's a rare *bow rider* model - a style which is much more common in modern boats.

After purchase I discovered a water leak in the outboard that cost £250 to repair. This was my own fault as I didn't inspect the outboard properly or know what problems to look out for.
