*Apart from fuel the costs of running a boat can add up so budget accordingly*

# Annual recurring costs
- Insurance (budget £150 for a boat worth £5000)
- Breakdown cover (optional)
- [Boat storage fees]({{site.baseurl}}/Boat-storage)

# Main running costs
- Fuel (and 2-stroke oil if you have a 2-stroke)
- Maintenance and spare parts
- Mooring/short stay charges on trips

# Service intervals
Boats are typically serviced based on operating hours. This is because unlike cars they can spend a large proportion of their time at or close to the rev limit.
