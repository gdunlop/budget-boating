## Boat interior
An interior that's been kept in good condition definitely makes a boat more attractive. There are bound to be signs of wear and tear but seats and cushions can be expensive to replace so give them a good look over.

The interior of my boat pictured below certainly looks nice, though all the coverings were secured with cheap staples which had rusted. I recently removed every single one and replaced with stainless steel staples...

**Checks**
- Have a good jump around to check the floor is solid. If the owner agrees, use a sharp point or screwdriver to gently prod the floor checking for any soft spots. This is especially important if the floor is covered in carpet.
- Check condition of all fixed and removable cushions.
- If any of the seats adjust check operation to make sure the mechanisms work. Sit at the helm and make sure you can get a position you are comfortable with.
- If the boat has a ski locker in the floor, check inside. It should be fibreglass lined and pretty dry. If there's any water check where it's come from. Salt water may be due to a leaking drain plug or other through-hull fitting.
- Check visibility through the windscreen. They're often made of perspex or other plastics which are prone to crazing from UV and salt water. Although this can be replaced it involves removing the entire windscreen which is quite a big job.
- Check condition of fabric/vinyl covers. These usually attach with pop studs so check they're all present and working
- Make a note of dials on the dashboard so you can check later if they are working
- Is there any storage? Space for ropes, fenders, and everything else you will need on a trip?
