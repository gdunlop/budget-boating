*This is a long article, because there's lots of things to check when buying a boat!*

## Ready, steady, shop
So you've narrowed down the [type of boat you want]({{site.baseurl}}/Budget-boat-choices) with the [right type of engine]({{site.baseurl}}/Outboard-inboard).

You've also chosen a [storage option]({{site.baseurl}}/Boat-storage) that suits your budget, and have a good idea of [equipment you need to buy]({{site.baseurl}}/Essential-equipment) as well as running costs including [fuel]({{site.baseurl}}/Fuel-consumption) and [boat insurance]({{site.baseurl}}/Boat-insurance).

Great - you are ready to view and inspect some budget boats as a serious buyer.

The information in this section can be used as a checklist to make sure you inspect the boat thoroughly before making an offer. It will also help you walk away if you discover a serious problem.

## Boat hull and fittings
Most boats you come across will be made of GRP/fibreglass with a white or coloured gelcoat. Gelcoat is a resin-based paint that cures to a very hard surface 1-2mm thick, protecting the fibreglass laminate underneath.

![spider cracks in gelcoat]({{site.baseurl}}/images/spider.jpg)

It's common to see 'spider cracks' in gelcoat. This can be caused by stress in the hull, and also by screws if the holes in the gelcoat were not countersunk. Above the water line, spider cracks are really just a cosmetic issue. Removing them involves opening up the crack in the gelcoat - without damaging the fibreglass laminate - and applying fresh gelcoat in a matching colour. Relatively easy but time consuming and messy.

Spider cracks or indeed any cracks, dings or gouges in the gelcoat *below* the water line are a bigger problem. Water can get into the fibreglass laminate and cause it to break down. My boat had a *dirty bottom* resulting from a launching mishap or grounding. The gelcoat was scraped off but the laminate underneath was undamaged, so I fixed it by tidying up the edges of the damage and applying new gelcoat.

Timber is often used to provide structural support within fibreglass boats. It is commonly used as the core of the transom, *stringers* that run along the length of the boat and the floor. You must check these are sound and have not been damaged by water ingress.

**Checks**
- Tap all around the rear face of the transom with a rubber mallet or a screwdriver handle. If the tone of the sound changes or it is hollow-sounding the timber core may be rotten. This can be repaired but it's a big job involving cutting out the entire transom, fitting a new core, laying up fibreglass to strengthen the structure and applying new gelcoat.
- While you are here, check the drain plug at the bottom of the transom. It may be a nut that screws in to a plate, or a plastic bung.
- Examine the hull closely under the waterline looking for any stress cracks, gouges or scrapes in the gelcoat.
- Check any through-hull fittings under the waterline very carefully to ensure they are watertight
- Check all fittings above the waterline are secure (rails, cleats, brackets, boarding ladders, windscreens)
- Check the condition of the rub-rail. You may find evidence of a collision, so check the surrounding hull area carefully for any damage.
- Look in the anchor locker; budget for an anchor, chain and rode if this is not included in the sale.
- Check the winch strap is attached to a sturdy fitting on the bow. There should also be a chain or strong strap holding the bow in place, in case the winch fails.


## Boat interior
An interior that's been kept in good condition definitely makes a boat more attractive. There are bound to be signs of wear and tear but seats and cushions can be expensive to replace so give them a good look over.

The interior of my boat pictured below certainly looks nice, though all the coverings were secured with cheap staples which had rusted. I recently removed every single one and replaced with stainless steel staples...

![Boat interior]({{site.baseurl}}/images/interior.jpg)

**Checks**
- Have a good jump around to check the floor is solid. If the owner agrees, use a sharp point or screwdriver to gently prod the floor checking for any soft spots. This is especially important if the floor is covered in carpet.
- Check condition of all fixed and removable cushions.
- If any of the seats adjust check operation to make sure the mechanisms work. Sit at the helm and make sure you can get a position you are comfortable with.
- If the boat has a ski locker in the floor, check inside. It should be fibreglass lined and pretty dry. If there's any water check where it's come from. Salt water may be due to a leaking drain plug or other through-hull fitting.
- Check visibility through the windscreen. They're often made of perspex or other plastics which are prone to crazing from UV and salt water. Although this can be replaced it involves removing the entire windscreen which is quite a big job.
- Check condition of fabric/vinyl covers. These usually attach with pop studs so check they're all present and working
- Make a note of dials on the dashboard so you can check later if they are working
- Is there any storage? Space for ropes, fenders, and everything else you will need on a trip?

## Engine and steering
You should get an experienced boat mechanic to inspect the engine and steering system if at all possible. I'm not familiar with inboards so the following basic checks apply to outboard-powered boats.

Steering is the most safety-critical system on boat so this needs particular attention. It may be hydraulic or a "Teleflex" steering cable. In both cases, the steering attaches to the outboard using a link rod - seen here on the right:

![Steering attachment on an outboard]({{site.baseurl}}/images/steering.jpg)

There is usually a single nyloc nut securing the link rod. If this becomes detached the whole outboard can swing freely from side to side. If this happens at speed the consequences could be fatal.

**Checks**
- Take the outboard top cover off and inspect the general condition of the engine. It should be rust-free with tidy wiring and no obvious signs of salt deposits.
- Check all hoses appear in good condition with no obvious surface damage. They should be secured neatly with jubilee clips.
- You may get a faint whiff of petrol when the cover is removed but if the smell persists there may be a fuel leak.
- Get the owner to do a cold start. Modern fuel-injected 4-stroke outboards should start on the button, but older 2-strokes with carbs can be harder to start. Never crank the starter for more than 10 seconds, and if it doesn't start on the third attempt it needs further investigation. If it doesn't crank at all the battery may be dead.
- Check for a stream of water from the tell-tale. This is a small pipe usually on the underside of the main outboard cover where water exits after circulating around the engine. It may take 20-30 seconds for the engine to heat up enough to open the thermostats and start the flow. A trickle or no water at all indicate a problem with the impeller or blocked cooling channels within the powerhead. Further investigation will be needed to diagnose.
- This is a good time to check if the dials on the dashboard are working. A rev counter and fuel gauge are the absolute minimum. You may also find gauges for water temperature, voltage, and perhaps engine trim - all good to have. Speedometers in older boats often don't work; this is not a problem as you are likely to use a GPS-equipped mobile phone or chartplotter to obtain speed.
- Check for play in the main steering yoke. To do this, with the outboard near vertical, push down on the cavitation plate *gently*. If you feel any play there is wear in the steering column somewhere.
- Get the owner to apply full lock port then starboard, and check the outboard moves smoothly. You should also check the steering from the helm yourself to make sure it is not too stiff - if it is stiff this could indicate an issue with the cable or corrosion in the steering tube.
- Check the outboard trim up/down can be operated from the outboard - usually via a switch on the cowling - and from the helm. There is usually a toggle switch on the throttle handle that you operate with your thumb:

![Trim buttons on throttle]({{site.baseurl}}/images/throttle.jpg)

## Electrics
It's not uncommon to see a mess of wires like this under the dashboard or behind the console on a boat:

![Boat wiring mess]({{site.baseurl}}/images/wiring-mess.jpg)

This may not be an immediate issue, but will make troubleshooting difficult if not impossible. However, if the engine starts, the dials work and the trim mechanism operates correctly at least you know the main electrical systems are working.

**Checks**
- Look for a battery isolation switch. This is essential so you can prevent the battery draining while the boat is not in use.
- There should be a fuse panel somewhere. Follow the leads from the battery isolation switch to find it and check fuses are in place.
- Large boats often have multiple batteries in separate banks, but a smaller budget boat may have just a single battery for starting the engine and powering onboard circuits. This is obviously a single point of failure, so you may want to add a jump pack to your [essential equipment list]({{site.baseurl}}/Essential-equipment).
- Check electrical systems work, which may include: horn, interior lighting, navigation lights, anchor light, stereo, wipers and bilge pump. Bilge pumps usually have an 'always on' mode and an 'auto' mode so the switch may have three positions including 'off'.

## Trailers
You can tell a lot about a trailer from its overall visual appearance. The main frame and fixings should be rust free and the wheels should look in good order. Well known brands include Extreme Trailers, Indespension, SBS and De Graff.

![Boat trailer with rollers]({{site.baseurl}}/images/trailer.jpg)

Avoid DIY boat trailers at all costs as they may well be illegal. You can be fined a large amount for towing an unsafe load so you **must** check the total weight of the trailer and boat is within your car's towing capacity. See the weight and width restrictions for [towing with a car](https://www.gov.uk/towing-with-car).

The boat weight should also be within the trailer's capacity but this is rather more difficult to check. My trailer is rated at 1500kg, which means the maximum combined weight of the trailer and boat must not exceed 1500kg - this is *just* inside the capacity for my tow car. The unladen trailer weighs 350kg, so the maximum boat weight is 1150kg.

If the overall tow weight is over 750kg the trailer must be braked. These can seize if the trailer is regularly used to launch in salt water and the brakes are not flushed after each use. It's illegal to tow over 750kg unless it's braked so check they've not been removed. A *flush kit* can be added so you simply hook up a hose and it flushes fresh water through the brake drums.

Wheel bearings are one of the main wear items on a trailer, but again these are hard to check without lifting each wheel in turn and checking for play. Ask the owner when the bearings were last serviced and budget £30-40 per wheel to replace.

**Checks**
- The hull should be well supported on flat beds/rollers. Check the rear of the hull in particular - it should not be hanging off the back of the trailer by anything more than 30cm.
- If braked, check the handbrake works and all cables look in good condition.
- Check the hitch handle moves freely.
- There should be a breakaway cable fitted. It attaches to the handbrake mechanism on a braked trailer. Check the cable is in good condition.
- Check condition of winch strap and confirm the winch works.
- On a roller trailer, check all the rollers are present and secured with split pins.
- Check tyre condition; flat spots are common if trailer has been sitting for a while.
- If a lightboard is included check it's compatible with the connector on your tow vehicle and that all lights are working.
