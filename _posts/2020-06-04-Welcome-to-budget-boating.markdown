*A blog for anyone looking to get into powerboating on a budget*

# How budget is budget?
I set myself a budget of £5,000 for my first boat including a roadworthy trailer. For this amount you can find something in the 14-20ft range with service history and perhaps some recent upgrades or improvements.

You can obviously spend a lot more than this to get a newer or bigger boat but that would be stretching the budget part of 'budget boating'.

# New or used?
Needless to say given this budget you will be looking at used boats.

Don't be afraid of looking at older boats. If they have been well looked after ideally by one owner you can get a lot for your money.

# Where to find budget boats
I recommend looking at classified ads where the owner is likely to have given a realistic asking price. Avoid auctions as it's just too easy to get caught in a bidding war.

Boat brokers and specialist boating sites are another option. Brokers sell boats on behalf of a customer - brokerage boats - and may also have trade-ins. At our budget these will often be *sold as seen* with no warranty so you need to inspect carefully before parting with your cash.

# Beware the project boat

Front gardens and boat yards across the country are littered with project boats. Probably bought at auction with the best of intentions, they may have been sitting unloved for years.

Alternatively they've become a money pit for the current owner but just need "a few little things" to finish off. That may include small things like fitting a new engine.

Avoid project boats *unless* you find a very good example that you are prepared to put a lot of work - and cash - into.


# My personal experience
I looked at classified ads on eBay and Gumtree, as well as brokerage boats. I put a 10% deposit on a brokerage boat in the North of England, but unfortunately I made the mistake of paying this directly to the owner via a 'friends and family' payment. When it became apparent there were some issues with the engine I pulled out but the seller refused to return even a portion of the deposit. Caveat emptor...

I ended up buying a Fletcher Arrowhawk 180 from a private seller - a retired guy who bought and sold Fletchers. Despite being nearly 30 years old, it had a brand new roller trailer with a receipt for £2,500 and some service history with the outboard. Best of all it had been used as a ski boat on fresh water, and had numerous upgrades including a new fuel system (tank, pipes, water separating filter) and refurbished interior. It's a rare *bow rider* model - a style which is much more common in modern boats.

After purchase I discovered a water leak in the outboard that cost £250 to repair. This was my own fault as I didn't inspect the outboard properly or know what problems to look out for.
