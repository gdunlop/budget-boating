*"Be prepared" is the motto so here is some advice on the essential equipment for safe boating in inshore waters*

# Safety kit

![Safety kit](/budget-boating/images/safety.png)

- Kill cord
- Spare key with another kill cord
- Fire extinguisher fitted in the boat
- Lifejackets (manual inflators)
- VHF radios (two handhelds)
- Rope; long length for towing or mooring
- Mooring ropes
- Anchor, chain and rode
- Flexible bucket, for bailing or storing anchor. Could also be used as a sea anchor.
- Paper charts and compass
- Pair of oars. A boat up to 5 or 6 metres can be moved (slowly) if you sit at the bow and take turns paddling either side.

I don't carry flares as I only use the boat in busy inshore waters in fine weather.

If I ever planned to use the boat alone it would be sensible to get a Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) and a lifejacket that inflates automatically.

# Dry bag
- Spare VHF handheld
- Spare warm clothing
- Bin bags; use as a 'body bag' to retain heat if someone is recovered from the water fully clothed
- Food and water
- First aid kit
- Suncream
- Hats

# Toolkit
I carry a small toolkit and some spares on all trips. If you are unlucky enough to break down at least you can attempt a repair before asking for help.

- Socket set including spark plug remover
- Screwdrivers
- Set of spanners 3-17mm
- Hammer
- Side cutters
- Pliers
- Utility knife
- Zip ties in various sizes
- Small can of WD-40
- Insulating tape and gaffer tape
- Voltmeter
- Fine sandpaper for cleaning electrical connections
- 600A jump pack in case of flat battery. This can be used to charge phones/VHF radios and also has torch built in

# Spares
- Fuses for internal boat electrics and outboard
- Spark plugs
- Hose clips various sizes
- Spare fuel and 2-stroke oil

My boat has a 60 litre fuel tank and a separate 2-stroke oil tank. Fuel tank is filled from jerry cans rather than using marina facilities. Spare fuel is carried in 5 litre plastic cans, stored in the ski locker to keep the weight low.
