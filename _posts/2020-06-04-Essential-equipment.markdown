*"Be prepared" is the motto so here is some advice on the essential equipment for safe boating in inshore waters*

# Safety kit

For a small boat used in sheltered waters the following equipment is a sensible starting point:-
- Main key with kill cord
- Spare key with another kill cord
- Fire extinguisher fitted in the boat
- Lifejackets including a spare
- VHF radio
- Rope; long length for towing or mooring
- Mooring ropes and fenders
- Anchor, chain and rode
- Flexible bucket, for bailing or storing anchor. If you lose power, can also use this with the long length of rope to create a sea anchor
- Paper charts and compass
- Pair of oars. A boat up to 5 or 6 metres can be moved (slowly) if you sit at the bow and take turns paddling either side

# Grab bag
Have a dry bag packed with the following kit:-
- Backup VHF handheld radio
- Spare mobile phone
- Spare warm clothing
- Bin bags or survival sacks. These are to retain heat if you recover someone from the water and they are fully clothed.
- Some food and water
- First aid kit
- Suncream
- Hats

# Toolkit
A modest toolkit and basic spares may get you home without having to call for help.

My toolkit contains:-
- Socket set including spark plug remover
- Screwdrivers
- Set of spanners 3-17mm
- Hammer
- Side cutters
- Pliers
- Utility knife
- Zip ties in various sizes
- Small can of WD-40
- Insulating tape and gaffer tape
- Voltmeter
- Fine sandpaper for cleaning electrical connections

# Spares
I don't go overboard with spares - no pun intended. Since my boat only has a single battery for starting and powering onboard equipment, I invested in a portable jump pack. Starting a large 2-stroke outboard with high compression takes a lot of battery power.

- Fuses for internal boat electrics and outboard
- Spark plugs
- Hose clips various sizes
- Spare fuel and 2-stroke oil
- 600A jump pack in case of flat battery. Can be used to charge phones/VHF radios and also has a torch built in

# Fuel
My boat has a 60 litre fuel tank and a separate 2-stroke oil tank.

I generally fill the tank on land from jerry cans rather than using marina facilities. Spare fuel is carried in 5 litre plastic cans, stored in the ski locker to keep the weight low.
