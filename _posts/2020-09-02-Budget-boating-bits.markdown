*Some recent budget upgrades to my safety equipment*

### Jacket in
In an earlier post I covered some of the [essential equipment]({{site.baseurl}}/Essential-equipment) you should carry when boating, including tools and lifejackets.

My existing lifejackets include a CO2 gas canister that rapidly inflates the bladder when you pull a cord. These are known as manual inflators as you need to pull the cord when required. I carry out an annual check including using the oral inflation tube to make sure all lifejackets hold air for 24 hours.

There is nothing wrong with my lifejackets but Gumtree provided an opportunity to upgrade recently.

### Automatic for the people
Automatic inflators include a mechanism that pierces the CO2 gas canister on contact with water, as well as a traditional pull cord as a backup. If you end up in the water either unconscious or disoriented the lifejacket inflates automatically, and assuming it's wore correctly will flip you on to your back.

I picked up several of these Kru Sport Pro 150 lifejackets for £40 each - a substantial saving on their original purchase cost of £135.

### Throw me a line
I also added a rescue throw line to the other safety equipment stored on my boat. This provides a quick way to deploy a rope to assist someone in the water. Following other advice I also bought a folding safety knife that can be used to cut rope.
