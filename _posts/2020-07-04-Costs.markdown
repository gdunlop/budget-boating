*Full breakdown of annual running costs for a budget boat*

### Recap
Previous posts have mentioned several of the costs involved running a boat including [storage]({{site.baseurl}}/Boat-storage) and [insurance]({{site.baseurl}}/Boat-insurance).

### Annual costs
The table below gives a comprehensive list of the costs for running my 18ft trailerable speedboat.

To provide a point of comparison, I've also included the costs for running a larger 26ft sportscruiser kept in a marina. These are from a recent video by Nick Burnham a.k.a [Aquaholic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ8kxp_I7o0).

Fuel costs obviously need to be added to this but will vary a lot depending on usage.

| Description | Budget Boat | Comparison |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Berthing/storage | £360 | £2,500 |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Insurance | £140 | £400 |

| Annual lift | - | £400 |

| Anti-foul paint | - | £150 |

| Anodes | - | £100 |

| Servicing | £250 | £1,300 |

| Seastart | - | £150 |
| **Total per annum** | £750 | £5,000 |

### Servicing costs
My budget of £250 is enough to cover a full service every other year including replacing the impeller, fuel filters, spark plugs and gearbox oil.

Servicing an inboard engine is anything from £500 per engine and may be double this amount if you use an authorised dealer. Sterndrive units also need servicing every other year at an additional £500 per unit. You can half these costs if buy the parts and do the work yourself.
