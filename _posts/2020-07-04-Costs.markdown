*Full breakdown of annual running costs for the budget boater*

### Recap
Previous posts have mentioned some of the costs involved running a boat including [storage]({{site.baseurl}}/Boat-storage) and [insurance]({{site.baseurl}}/Boat-insurance).

### Annual costs
The table below lists the main annual costs for running my 18ft trailerable speedboat.

To provide a point of comparison, I've also included the costs for running a larger 26ft sportscruiser. These are from a recent video by Nick Burnham a.k.a [Aquaholic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ8kxp_I7o0).
